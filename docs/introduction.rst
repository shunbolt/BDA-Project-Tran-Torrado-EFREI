Introduction
============

This project is a Machine Learning Project from the Big Data Applications course. The project was done by RaphaÃ«l Tran & Yoann Torrado and uses the dataset **Home Client Risk Classification** to build a model that predicts whether or not a client is able to repay his loan or not.

The dataset is provided at this `link <https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data>`_

The project has a repository under the following `link <https://github.com/shunbolt/BDA-Project-Tran-Torrado-EFREI>`_

The project is based on three models :

- XGboost
- RandomForest
- Gradient Boosting

The project also uses MLflow library to handle the lifecycle of the ML project as well as XAI tools like SHAP after the model is built.
