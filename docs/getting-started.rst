Getting started
===============

This is where you describe how to get set up on a clean install, including the
commands necessary to get the raw data (using the `sync_data_from_s3` command,
for example), and then how to make the cleaned, final data sets.

A function can be described as followed :

.. py:function:: enumerate(sequence[,start=0])
   
	Return an iterator that yields tuples of an index and an item of the *sequence*.
